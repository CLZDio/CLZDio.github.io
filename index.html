<p>
In order to evaluate and possibly enter into a business transaction (the “<strong>Purpose</strong>”), [Entity] and the other party identified below agree to these terms.
</p>
<p>
A party (the “<strong>Discloser</strong>”) may disclose to the other party (the “<strong>Recipient</strong>”) information pertaining to the Purpose that the Discloser considers confidential (“<strong>Confidential Information</strong>”).
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Restriction on use and disclosure</span>. Recipient may use Confidential Information only for the Purpose. Recipient must use a reasonable degree of care to protect Confidential Information and to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information. Recipient may share Confidential Information with its employees, directors, agents or third-party contractors who need to know it and if they have  a written obligation to keep the information confidential.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Confidential information exclusions</span>. Confidential Information does not include information that:(a) was known to Recipient without restriction before receipt from Discloser; (b) is publicly available through no fault of Recipient; (c) is rightfully received by Recipient from a third party without a duty of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by Recipient. A party may disclose Confidential Information when compelled to do so by law if it provides reasonable prior notice to the other party, unless a court orders that the other party not be given notice.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Termination</span>. Either party may terminate this agreement with thirty days prior written notice, but this agreement’s provisions will survive as to Confidential Information that is disclosed before termination.
</p>
<p>
This agreement imposes no obligation to proceed with any business transaction, does not create any agency or partnership relationship, and is not assignable or transferable by either party without the prior written consent of the other party and any purported assignment or transfer is void.
</p>
<p>
No party acquires any intellectual property rights under this agreement except the limited rights necessary to use the Confidential Information for the Purpose.
</p>
<p>
This agreement is the parties’ entire agreement on this topic, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements. Any amendments must be in writing. The parties may execute this agreement in counterparts, which taken together will constitute one instrument. Failure to enforce any of the provisions of this agreement will not constitute a waiver.
</p>
<p>
This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict-of-laws principles. The exclusive venue for any dispute relating to this agreement shall be San Francisco, California.
